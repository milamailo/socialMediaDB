# Social Media Database
- a simple database structure and practical scripts


This project sets up a MySQL database for a social media platform, tracking users, friendships, posts, comments, and reactions. Users can make posts, comment on posts, and react (like) to posts. The database schema and sample data insertion scripts are included.

## Project Structure

The database consists of the following tables:

- **Users**: Stores information about platform users, including usernames, names, emails, and the date they joined.
- **Friendships**: Tracks friendships between users, establishing a many-to-many relationship.
- **Posts**: Contains user-generated content.
- **Comments**: Stores comments made by users on posts.
- **Reactions**: Tracks user reactions (like, love, haha, etc.) to posts.
